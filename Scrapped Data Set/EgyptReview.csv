835,55539,Extremely unprofessional tour guide.
836,55539,The trip was interesting but the organisation and effort put forth on the trip was rather weak. We had no real help from our tour guide with pushy locals.
837,55539,Have a local tour manager trash talk us to other guests is terrible.
838,55539,There were too many issues with the tour. Our felucca got rammed into in the middle of the night and nothing got done about it - as if though it never happened. Also our guide wasn’t any good either.
839,55539,Jordan was worth it. Egypt was not. I did not learn much from the guide. We were promised a coach bus but was given a tiny van. Everything was a hassle.
840,55539,"A ""coach"" and a mini-van are not interchangeable for an overnight trip. The correspondence about this was unacceptable! Everything else was excellent!"
